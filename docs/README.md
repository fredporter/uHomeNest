## Consolidated map (uHomeNest)

| Topic | Where |
| --- | --- |
| **Product version** | Repo root [`../VERSION`](../VERSION) (**3.9.x**); changelog [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) |
| **v4 roadmap (uHOME)** | [`ROADMAP-V4.md`](ROADMAP-V4.md) · current delivery detail in [`UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md`](UHOME-DEV-ROADMAP.md) |
| **Monorepo** | [`MONOREPO.md`](MONOREPO.md) |
| **Universal dev + USXD** | [`../dev/UNIVERSAL-DEV.md`](../dev/UNIVERSAL-DEV.md) |
| **Retiring old files locally** | [`../dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md`](../dev/COMPOST-LEGACY.md) |
| **USXD uHOME surfaces (interchange)** | Sibling repo [`UniversalSurfaceXD/docs/uhome/README.md`](https://github.com/fredporter/UniversalSurfaceXD/blob/main/docs/uhome/README.md) |

---

`docs/` is the **stable reference** lane for `uHOME-server`, aligned with the
uDOS family split:

| Lane | Location | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Reference | [`docs/`](README.md) (here) | Architecture, clients, ops, specs |
| Wiki | [`../wiki/`](../wiki/README.md) | Short units and quick orientation |
| Learning | [`../learning/`](../learning/README.md) | Study order, courses pointers, uDOS Library links |

Tutorial and student-facing step-through material also lives under
[`courses/`](../courses/README.md) (repo root) with maintainer notes in
`docs/courses/`. This tree is for architecture, pathway, client, operational,
and implementation documentation tied to the real repo.

## Entry Points

### Use

- [../QUICKSTART.md](../QUICKSTART.md) for the fastest local run path
- [../FIRST-TIME-INSTALL.md](../FIRST-TIME-INSTALL.md) for clean-machine setup
- [USE.md](pathway/USE.md) for the current operator path
- [UHOME-DASHBOARD.md](ui/UHOME-DASHBOARD.md) for the dashboard surface
- [BEACON-ACTIVATE.md](clients/BEACON-ACTIVATE.md)
  for local portal and vault-reader positioning
- [SONIC-STANDALONE-RELEASE-AND-INSTALL.md](howto/SONIC-STANDALONE-RELEASE-AND-INSTALL.md)
  for release and install guidance

### Learn

- [README.md](pathway/README.md) in `docs/pathway/` for repo positioning
- [uHOME-server-education-dev-brief.md](uHOME-server-education-dev-brief.md)
  for the local pathway brief
- [UHOME-v1.5.md](specs/UHOME-v1.5.md) for the current canonical spec

### Build

- [UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md](architecture/UHOME-SERVER-DEV-PLAN.md) for the
  active repo-local development plan
- [uHOME-server-dev-brief.md](uHOME-server-dev-brief.md) for contributor workflow
  (optional `@dev` / `#binder` parity; uHOME defaults to roadmap + issues)
- [thin-ui-feature-completion.md](thin-ui-feature-completion.md) for thin UI and
  product feature checklists
- [uHOME-server-education-dev-brief.md](uHOME-server-education-dev-brief.md)
  for the education-structure brief
- [PHASE-1-IA-MAP.md](architecture/PHASE-1-IA-MAP.md) for current-to-target mapping
- [ROOT-POLICY.md](architecture/ROOT-POLICY.md) for canonical vs transitional roots
- [PHASE-1-CHECKLIST.md](architecture/PHASE-1-CHECKLIST.md) for the completed
  Information Architecture deliverables
- [PHASE-2-CHECKLIST.md](architecture/PHASE-2-CHECKLIST.md) for the completed
  installer-boundary cleanup inside `uHOME-server`
- [PHASE-3-CHECKLIST.md](architecture/PHASE-3-CHECKLIST.md) for the completed
  decentralized LAN-model milestone
- [PHASE-3-LAN-KICKOFF.md](architecture/PHASE-3-LAN-KICKOFF.md) for the
  kickoff and boundary notes for the LAN-model phase
- [PHASE-4-HOST-PROFILES-KICKOFF.md](architecture/PHASE-4-HOST-PROFILES-KICKOFF.md)
  for the Phase 4 kickoff and boundary notes
- [PHASE-4-CHECKLIST.md](architecture/PHASE-4-CHECKLIST.md) for the completed
  install-profile milestone
- [PHASE-4-COMPLETION.md](architecture/PHASE-4-COMPLETION.md) for the summary
  of canonical Phase 4 surfaces
- [REPO-FAMILY.md](pathway/REPO-FAMILY.md) for family-boundary and companion-repo rules
- the deprecated `uhome_server.sonic` namespace is compatibility-only; new
  repo-local work should use `uhome_server.installer`

## Family library (GitHub Pages)

The **uDOS Library** indexes uHOME repos (Docs / Wiki / Learning links) from
[`uDOS-docs` `site/data/family-source.json`](https://github.com/fredporter/uDOS-docs/blob/main/site/data/family-source.json).
The public **Learning hub** is `https://fredporter.github.io/uDOS-docs/learning.html`
when Pages is deployed.
