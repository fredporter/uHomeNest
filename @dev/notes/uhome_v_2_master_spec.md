# uHOME v2 Master Architecture Specification

(Upgraded from v1.5.3 Kiosk + Local Network Server Spec)

---

# Purpose

uHOME v2 defines the **local-first household server platform** for the uDOS ecosystem.

It provides:

- local infrastructure host
- kiosk UI environment
- home automation integration
- local vault and service hosting
- media and game services
- automation extension runtime
- controller‑first household interface

uHOME is designed to operate **independently of cloud services**, while still supporting optional integration through the Empire extension.

The system is composed of:

- uHOME-server (core)
- uHOME-matter extension
- uDOS-empire extension
- optional Android / iOS / tablet kiosk and portal clients

---

# Upgrade from v1.5.3

The original **Android kiosk + LAN server concept** remains valid and is expanded into a full modular platform.

Key upgrades:

- kiosk concept generalized beyond Android
- controller-first design standardized
- streaming and device casting surfaces added
- automation and cloud sync modularized
- Home Assistant + Matter integrated as extension
- Jellyfin media server integrated into core
- Steam/game launcher capabilities formalized

---

# Repository Boundaries

uHOME remains **separate from the main uDOS repo**.

Repositories:

- uHOME-server
- uHOME-matter
- uDOS-empire
- uHOME-app-android
- uHOME-app-ios

Clients consume contracts exposed by uHOME-server.

---

# Topology

## Server

- always-on machine on local network
- hybrid Linux / Windows deployment supported

Preferred architecture:

Linux side hosts:

- uHOME-server
- Wizard
- Sonic
- Empire
- Jellyfin
- Matter subsystem

Windows "toybox" side may host:

- Steam
- auxiliary software
- gaming tools

Windows is **never the orchestration authority**.

Linux host remains the primary system controller.

- local vault access only
- no internet sharing

### Crypt

- visible network
- password protected
- local vault access
- no internet sharing

### Tomb

- hidden network
- discovery-based access
- no public internet access

### Home

- private household network

- may be hidden or visible

Wizard defines policies but **uHOME-server hosts the runtime services**.

---

# uHOME-matter Extension

The uHOME-matter extension provides:

- Home Assistant integration
- Matter device support
- device graph
- room/zone logic
- scenes and automations

Responsibilities:

- device pairing
- device state tracking
- automation triggers
- kiosk control panels

This extension integrates a cloned Home Assistant + Matter backend.

Device automation remains separate from Empire.

---

# uDOS-empire Extension

Empire provides **server automation and cloud sync**.

Responsibilities:

- vault mirroring
- Google API integration
- HubSpot API integration
- webhook listeners
- scheduled jobs
- binder-aware routing

Launcher mode

- entry point to services

Companion device

- secondary controller

---

# Acceptance Criteria

## MVP

- connect kiosk to local uHOME-server
- launcher UI functional
- controller navigation operational
- Thin‑GUI overlays visible
- job status visible

## Phase 2

- media browsing stable
- Jellyfin integration
- Steam launcher integration

- household roles
- infrastructure visualization

---

# Design Principles

- local-first
- controller-first UX
- modular extensions
- no mandatory cloud dependency
- server-hosted automation

uHOME acts as the **household digital infrastructure hub** for the uDOS ecosystem.
